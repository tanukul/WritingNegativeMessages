                    ​Before you start writing your message to Kenisha, the team leader, you decide to seek the advice of Lloyd Baskin, Chairman of the Executive Committee. He has been with the company since its beginnings. You explain the situation, and he tells you, "Keep in mind that this company started out as an engineering firm, and it's still an engineering firm at heart. However, we've evolved here a bit. In the old dinosaur days, if you messed up, you were told about your failure in no uncertain terms. Today, we're a bit kinder and gentler. We'll still let you know when you mess up, but we try to be a little more sympathetic."

                    <br />
                    With Baskin's words in mind, you consider how to begin your message to the team leader. You believe you've got some options. Consider the opening approaches below and determine which would be the most appropriate way, given the situation and Baskin's advice.

                    <span class="Open-Sans-Font-16px ">
                        You chose to begin by issuing an apology.
                        <span style="color:#77b401;">
                            <strong> This was not the best choice. </strong>
                        </span>
                        An apology can make the delivery of your bad news more awkward and difficult, because apologies can be construed in many different ways. It may be an expression of sympathy that something negative has happened to the other person, or it might be taken as an admission of guilt.

                    <span class="Open-Sans-Font-16px ">
                        You chose to open with a buffer statement. 
                        <span style="color:#1d7527;">
                            <strong> This was the best choice. </strong>
                        </span>
                        A well-written buffer statement that shows appreciation for the team's efforts will help create a shared understanding of the situation and encourage a sense of trust as you deliver the negative message. However, be careful not to divert attention from the problem with insincere flattery or mislead the team into thinking your message actually contains good news.​

                            </span>
                            You will have delivered the news, but perhaps not in the most constructive way. First, you've ignored Baskin's advice to be "a bit kinder and gentler." Second, although this approach is candid, it might cause more problems than it solves if Kenisha tunes out as soon as she learns of the rejection.
