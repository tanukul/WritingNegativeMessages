                    ​The first issue you chose to address with Kenisha is the size and styling of the prototype. One objection raised by the focus groups conducted by the marketing department is that the Radio-DRM is too big to fit into their entertainment centers and its bulk makes it equally unattractive if they wanted to place it on a bookshelf or tabletop.

                    Which of the following statements would be the best explanation for the rejection based on the focus groups' feedback that the product was not stylish?

                                        ​Let's address an issue that was brought up in the focus groups—style. Many consumers felt that the Radio-DRM was too large to fit into their entertainment centers. If they don't have an entertainment center, they want electronics that are sleek and look attractive on a bookshelf or tabletop, and they thought the Radio-DRM was too bulky and unattractive. I'd like to see the team try to streamline the design to make it more in line with customer expectations.

                                    <span>
                                        ​One reason we rejected the prototype comes down to style. On the plus side, the Radio-DRM is built like a battleship. On the negative side, focus group customers don't want battleships in their entertainment centers, on their bookshelves, or on their tabletops. They want a product that is sleek and stylish and looks good. Start thinking like customers, not engineers, and make the design sexier.

                                        ​The good news, Kenisha, is that the first issue with respect to the Radio-DRM prototype is one that should be relatively easy for your team to solve: style. Based on the data we received from our focus groups, the Radio-DRM is too big ​and bulky, and lacks the sleek sophistication that consumers want in their electronics. Perhaps this is because you've over-engineered the product and put in too many controls, knobs, and displays, but it's not going over well with potential consumers.
