                        Structural Sound is a precision electronics company situated on a large campus-like setting near a major city that sells innovative, high-end speakers, headphones, and other quality audio products at its popular stand-alone stores located in big cities and shopping malls across the United States.
						<br/> 
                        <br /> 
                        As the Research and Development (R&D) Manager, you have evaluated a prototype submitted by one of your teams for a product called the Radio-DRM. This product boasts AM radio that sounds like FM; improved reception quality; low-cost, energy-efficient receivers and easy tuning; and text information from radio stations.
						<br/>
						<br/>
                        The team has been working on the project for over 18 months, and they want the green light to start production. You have the difficult task of giving them the bad news of a "no" answer for the proposal as it currently stands.
