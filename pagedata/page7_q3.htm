                    You're about to start drafting your message when Lloyd Baskin calls. "I forgot to tell you one other thing. Although it's important that you state the bad news clearly to Kenisha, I'm a little concerned that she'll take the news badly. You might try softening the impact of the bad news by using a passive voice instead of an active one. Sometimes using a passive voice seems less like an accusation. Just a suggestion!"

                    <br />
                    You remember from your college courses that, in an active voice, the subject performs the action of the verb. In a passive voice, the subject does not perform the action of the verb.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    After he hangs up, you ponder his advice and try your hand at drafting sentences that use both an active voice and a passive voice.
