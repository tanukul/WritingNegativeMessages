                    ​The second issue you chose to address with Kenisha is the complexity of the product. The marketing department conducted numerous focus groups to gauge their reaction to the prototype, and the feedback from these focus groups revealed that customers perceived the product to be too complicated and not sufficiently user-friendly.

                    <br />
                    Which of the following statements would be the best explanation for the rejection based on the focus groups' feedback that the product was too complex?

                       An ideal explanation defuses the emotions that accompany bad news and uses neutral language instead of accusations or blame.

                        Although you start out using positive language in your rejection, the latter part of your explanation is mean-spirited. Your explanation should focus on the issues at hand and defuse the emotions that accompany the bad news.

                            Although the statement uses neutral rather than negative language, it doesn't give Kenisha enough details.​ It mentions the complexity of the prototype, but it doesn't describe or identify those problems. On the basis of this statement, Kenisha is unlikely to understand how to fix the problems.
