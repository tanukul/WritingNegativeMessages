                    ​You've decided to begin breaking the bad news to Kenisha with a buffer statement that will hopefully "soften the blow." You're aware that you can use a variety of buffer statements, such as expressing your appreciation, demonstrating that you understand the other person's needs or goals, or conveying your willingness to help.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Of the following options, which buffer statement would be the most appropriate for this situation?

It's also important to recognize that one of the keys to successful prototyping is working through a number of models and exploring different approaches before finally including the best features and removing the problematic ones for the final solution.

                        You are recognizing the team's accomplishments, and the fact that the prototype has some shortcomings does not detract from the team's overall accomplishment. After having established some trust, you can now move to delivering the bad news in a way that it is likely to be well-accepted.

                       On the plus side, you're acknowledging the team's work and progress. However, the phrasing about bringing the Radio-DRM into production and the "great progress" the team has made may mislead Kenisha into thinking your message actually contains good news.

                            This is not a buffer statement; it is a blatant, in-your-face rejection of the team's efforts and is likely to be received poorly. At this point, Kenisha may be so upset that she won't appreciate what else you have to say.

                            Calling attention to today's super-competitive market is a legitimate way to soften the blow. That is also true of calling attention to the keys to successful prototyping. However, this statement doesn't acknowledge the effort that the team has put into the existing prototype.
