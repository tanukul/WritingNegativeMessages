		<p>
				In this simulation, you will be given a business situation or challenge and asked to make a series of decisions. As in any
				business situation, there are multiple approaches, resulting outcomes, and solutions for every situation. To provide you
				with an authentic real-world business experience, we have designed this simulation with multiple decision choices that
				lead you down different scenario paths. For this reason, the paths you take and your overall experience will be different
				than that of your fellow students. After clicking the Submit button for each decision, you will find out whether you made
				the best choice, an OK choice, a choice that was really not the best, or an incorrect choice. In addition, you will be
				given specific feedback on the decision you made.

			<h4>A few key points about this simulation:</h4>
			<nav>
				<ul>
					<li>
						At certain points within this simulation, you will arrive at Mentoring Moment segments. These segments provide an opportunity
						for you to practice your decision making and learn more about a particular topic. Any interactivity completed in Mentoring
						Moments does not count toward the simulation grade you earn.
					</li>
					<li>As you work through the simulation, the progress bar at the top of your screen will show the percentage of the scenario
						you have completed.</li>
					<li>You can navigate to previous points within this simulation by clicking on the expandable menu in the top left corner
						of your screen (the three bars). You cannot, however, go backward in the simulation and change a decision that has already
						been submitted.</li>
				</ul>
			</nav>
			<p>At the end of this simulation, you will receive a percentage score based on the decisions you made, a summary of each situation
				and the choice you made, and a link to the eText for additional information on that topic.</p>
