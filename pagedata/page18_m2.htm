                    At some point in your career, you're going to be faced with the prospect of having to deliver bad news. Although it's never easy or even comfortable, there are techniques you can use to explain the reasons for the bad news to try to get your audience's attention and control how they will react to the bad news.

                    When you are explaining reasons for having to deliver bad news, consider these strategies:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Tell your audience what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. Share relevant facts and reasons that your audience needs to understand the negative message. Provide enough detail for the audience to understand your reasons, but be concise.</li>
                        <li>Don't trivialize the issue (such as prefacing the news with "This isn't a big deal, but..."). You may think you're being gentle, but you may also be giving your audience false hope.</li>
                        <li>Don't sugarcoat the bad news or the reasons. Mary Poppins may have believed that a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down, but bad news isn't any less palatable when it has a sweet coating.</li>
                      <li>See the situation through your audience's eyes. Focus your message on what matters to them. Deliver the bad news with honesty and sensitivity. Show empathy and try to maintain the self-esteem of your audience.</li>
                        <li>Deliver the bad news in clear but positive language. It may be hard to find that "silver lining," but try to find positives associated with the bad news, particularly if you have to maintain a working relationship with the audience after you deliver the bad news.</li>                        
                    </ol>
                    Most of all, when you have to deliver bad news, remember this: It's not about you. You might be uncomfortable and/or might not want to deliver the bad news, but what ultimately matters is that you provide your audience with insight and understanding, and that you are in control and caring.
