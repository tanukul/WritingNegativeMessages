                        This statement delivered the news and showed concern at the same time. However, it does not make it clear that you want the team to continue working on the device to fix the perceived flaws in the prototype.

                        The message is concerned and sympathetic, yet firm and direct. It also clearly identifies the expectation that the team will continue working on the device to fix the perceived flaws in the prototype.

                            On the plus side, your message is very direct and delivers the bad news. However, it is also blunt and somewhat harsh. Another option would have been a better choice.

                           The message is harsh, and bringing up the negative implications for the company will not help Kenisha and her team at this point. More likely, it will simply scare and upset her. You also did not tell her that you expect the team to continue working on the prototype and fix the flaws.
