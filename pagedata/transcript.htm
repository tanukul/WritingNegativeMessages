                            Structural Sound is a precision electronics company situated on a large campus-like setting near a major city that sells innovative, high-end speakers, headphones, and other quality audio products at its popular stand-alone stores located in big cities and shopping malls across the United States.

                            As the Research and Development (R&D) Manager, you have evaluated a prototype submitted by one of your teams for a product called the Radio-DRM. This product boasts AM radio that sounds like FM; improved reception quality; low-cost, energy-efficient receivers and easy tuning; and text information from radio stations.

                            The team has been working on the project for over 18 months, and they want the green light to start production. You have the difficult task of giving them the bad news of a "no" answer for the proposal as it currently stands.

                    Before you start writing your message to Kenisha, the team leader, you decide to seek the advice of Lloyd Baskin, Chairman of the Executive Committee. He has been with the company since its beginnings. You explain the situation, and he tells you, "Keep in mind that this company started out as an engineering firm, and it's still an engineering firm at heart. However, we've evolved here a bit. In the old dinosaur days, if you messed up, you were told about your failure in no uncertain terms. Today, we're a bit kinder and gentler. We'll still let you know when you mess up, but we try to be a little more sympathetic."

                    <br />
                    With Baskin's words in mind, you consider how to begin your message to the team leader. You believe you've got some options. Consider the opening approaches below and determine which would be the most appropriate way, given the situation and Baskin's advice.

                            You can start by issuing an apology for rejecting the prototype to show the team that you sympathize with them.

                            ​You can choose an indirect approach by beginning with a buffer statement that shows your appreciation for the team's accomplishment so far. This statement would "soften the blow" before you deliver the bad news.

                    You're about to start drafting your message when Lloyd Baskin calls. "I forgot to tell you one other thing. Although it's important that you state the bad news clearly to Kenisha, I'm a little concerned that she'll take the news badly. You might try softening the impact of the bad news by using a passive voice instead of an active one. Sometimes using a passive voice seems less like an accusation. Just a suggestion!"
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    You remember from your college courses that, in an active voice, the subject performs the action of the verb. In a passive voice, the subject does not perform the action of the verb.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    After he hangs up, you ponder his advice and try your hand at drafting sentences that use both an active voice and a passive voice.

                    Now that you've delivered the bad news to Kenisha that the Radio-DRM prototype will not be going into production, it's time to give her information about the reasons why the prototype was rejected.

                    <br />
                    You have identified three major issues with respect to the prototype:

                    The first issue you chose to address with Kenisha is the complexity of the product. The marketing department conducted numerous focus groups to gauge consumers' reaction to the prototype, and the feedback from these focus groups revealed that customers perceived the product to be too complicated and not sufficiently user-friendly.

                            ​We're overwhelmed with all of the great features the Radio-DRM has. The problem is that focus group customers thought that getting it to work was about as complicated as programming the <i>Starship Enterprise</i>. All they want to do is plug it in and set a few controls. They don't want to spend hours trying to figure out how to use it.

                    The first issue you chose to address with Kenisha is that production cost of the product appears to be too high versus the price customers would be willing to pay. The overwhelming sentiment of the focus groups conducted by the marketing department was that, although customers liked some of the advanced features of the Radio-DRM, they would not be willing to pay a higher price for these features. The result is that the profit margin for the Radio-DRM would be too low to justify going into production.

Although customers liked some of the Radio-DRM's advanced features, focus groups revealed that they wouldn't be willing to pay a higher price for those features. In short, the profit margin on the Radio-DRM is unacceptable as the product is currently configured. Your team needs to take aim at eliminating features that increase costs but add little value to the customer.

                        <span>
                            We've got a problem with cost. You've put lots of bells and whistles in the Radio-DRM, and that drives up the cost, but customers in the focus groups don't want to have to pay for those bells and whistles. They see those features as "nice-to-haves" that maybe they'll use and maybe they won't, but they certainly don't want to pay extra for them. If we go into production with this prototype, the company will be lucky if they break even, much less make a profit. Back to the drawing board, Kenisha!

                            ​First, let's talk about cost. To be blunt, you and your team need to be customer-focused, not technology-focused. Think about features our customers want, not just features that you want. You've put so many bells and whistles into the Radio-DRM that the production cost would be ridiculously high, and the focus groups show that customers don't want to pay extra for a lot of features they may or may not use. In short, we'd be lucky to break even on the Radio-DRM, much less make a profit. You and your team need to tweak the design so that you cut some of the unnecessary features and lower the cost.​​

                            One reason we're rejecting the prototype is the cost. You've made this product so fancy and added so many features that it's going to be horrifically expensive to produce, and our customers don't want to pay that much. That's what the focus groups have told us. Stop over-engineering the products and develop something that our customers want and that we can make a profit from.

                <p>
                    ​The first issue you chose to address with Kenisha is the size and styling of the prototype. One objection raised by the focus groups conducted by the marketing department is that the Radio-DRM is too big to fit into their entertainment centers and its bulk makes it equally unattractive if they wanted to place it on a bookshelf or tabletop.

                        <span>
                            One of the things we heard in the focus groups is that the Radio-DRM is simply too big and too bulky. Customers want sleek designs, not something that looks like their grandfather's radio. They've said that the unit is too big to fit into an entertainment center and just too ugly to put on a bookshelf or tabletop.
                        </span>

                    <p>
                        <span>
                            ​Let's address an issue that was brought up in the focus groups—style. Many consumers felt that the Radio-DRM was too large to fit into their entertainment centers. If they don't have an entertainment center, they want electronics that are sleek and look attractive on a bookshelf or tabletop, and they thought the Radio-DRM was too bulky and unattractive. I'd like to see the team try to streamline the design to make it more in line with customer expectations.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            ​One reason we rejected the prototype comes down to style. On the plus side, the Radio-DRM is built like a battleship. On the negative side, focus group customers don't want battleships in their entertainment centers, on their bookshelves, or on their tabletops. They want a product that is sleek and stylish and looks good. Start thinking like customers, not engineers, and make the design sexier.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            ​The good news, Kenisha, is that the first issue with respect to the Radio-DRM prototype is one that should be relatively easy for your team to solve: style. Based on the data we received from our focus groups, the Radio-DRM is too big ​and bulky, and lacks the sleek sophistication that consumers want in their electronics. Perhaps this is because you've over-engineered the product and put in too many controls, knobs, and displays, but it's not going over well with potential consumers.

                            Now let's talk about cost. To be blunt, you and your team need to be customer-focused, not technology-focused. Think about features our customers want, not just features that you want. You've put so many bells and whistles into the Radio-DRM that the production cost will be ridiculously high, and the focus groups show that customers don't want to pay extra for a lot of features they may or may not use. In short, we'd be lucky to break even on the Radio-DRM, much less make a profit. You and your team need to tweak the design so that you cut some of the unnecessary features and lower the cost.

You've made this product so fancy and added so many features that it's going to be horrifically expensive to produce, and our customers don't want to pay that much. That's what the focus groups have told us. Stop over-engineering the products and develop something that our customers want and that we can make a profit from.

                    The last issue you chose to address with Kenisha is that production cost of the product appears to be too high versus the price customers would be willing to pay. The overwhelming sentiment of the focus groups conducted by the marketing department was that, while customers liked some of the advanced features of the Radio-DRM, they would not be willing to pay a higher price for these features. The result is that the profit margin for the Radio-DRM would be too low to justify going into production.

                            ​​ ​Finally, another issue your team needs to address is production cost. Although customers liked some of the Radio-DRM's advanced features, focus groups revealed that they wouldn't be willing to pay a higher price for those features. In short, the profit margin on the Radio-DRM is unacceptable as the product is currently configured. Your team needs to take aim at eliminating features that increase costs but add little value to the customer.

                            ​​Finally, we've also got a problem with cost. You've put lots of bells and whistles in the Radio-DRM, and that drives up the cost, but customers in the focus groups don't want to have to pay for those bells and whistles. They see those as "nice-to-haves" that maybe they'll use and maybe they won't,  but they certainly don't want to pay extra for them. If we go into production with this prototype, the company will be lucky if they break even, much less make a profit. Back to the drawing board, Kenisha!

                            Finally, let's talk about cost.​ To be blunt, you and your team need to be customer-focused, not technology focused. Think about features our customers want, not just features that you want.  You've put so many bells and whistles into the Radio-DRM that the production cost will be ridiculously high, and the focus groups show that customers don't want to pay extra for a lot of features they may or may not use. In short, we'd be lucky to break even on the Radio-DRM, much less make a profit. ​You and your team need to tweak the design so that you cut some of the unnecessary features and lower the cost.

                            The final reason we're rejecting the prototype is the cost. You've made this product so fancy and added so many features that it's going to be horrifically expensive to produce, and our customers don't want to pay that much. That's what the focus groups have told us. Stop over-engineering the products and develop something that our customers want and that we can make a profit from.

                At some point in your career, you're going to be faced with the prospect of having to deliver bad news. Although it's never easy or even comfortable, there are techniques you can use to explain the reasons for the bad news to try to get your audience's attention and control how they will react to the bad news.
                <br />
                <br />
                When you are explaining reasons for having to deliver bad news, consider these strategies:
                <ol>
                    <li>Tell your audience what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. Share relevant facts and reasons that your audience needs to understand the negative message. Provide enough detail for the audience to understand your reasons, but be concise.</li>
                    <li>Don't trivialize the issue (such as prefacing the news with "This isn't a big deal, but..."). You may think you're being gentle, but you may also be giving your audience false hope.</li>
                    <li>Don't sugarcoat the bad news or the reasons. Mary Poppins may have believed that a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down, but bad news isn't any less palatable when it has a sweet coating.</li>
                    <li>See the situation through your audience's eyes. Focus your message on what matters to them. Deliver the bad news with honesty and sensitivity. Show empathy and try to maintain the self-esteem of your audience.</li>
                    <li>Deliver the bad news in clear but positive language. It may be hard to find that "silver lining," but try to find positives associated with the bad news, particularly if you have to maintain a working relationship with the audience after you deliver the bad news.</li>
                </ol>
                Most of all, when you have to deliver bad news, remember this: It's not about you. You might be uncomfortable and/or might not want to deliver the bad news, but what ultimately matters is that you provide your audience with insight and understanding, and that you are in control and caring.

                <p>
                    ​Now that you've covered the three issues with respect to the Radio-DRM prototype, it's time to close your message to Kenisha. As you did with the opening to your message, you have multiple options available to you.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Consider the closing approaches below and determine which conclusion would be​ the most appropriate, given the situation and the manner in which you have addressed it.

                        <span>
                            ​​ ​​In conclusion, I'm sorry that things didn't work out with the Radio-DRM prototype. I trust our decision is satisfactory.

                        <span>
                            In conclusion, I see this as a temporary setback for you and your team, not a roadblock. Given the remarkable progress you've made with respect to the Radio-DRM prototype, I have every reason to believe that you'll be able to readily address the issues and bring this prototype to full production.

                            ​I regret that the Radio-DRM prototype has been rejected at this time, but you're to be commended for what you've accomplished so far. If there is any way I can be of help, please let me know.

                        <span>
                            In conclusion, this is not a good situation. The company has lost valuable time due to your failure to produce an acceptable prototype, and spending more time fixing it will put us even further behind. You and your team have let us down. I hope you learn something from this experience; we certainly did.
