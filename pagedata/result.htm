                            ​Before you start writing your message to Kenisha, the team leader, you decide to seek the advice of Lloyd Baskin, Chairman of the Executive Committee. He has been with the company since its beginnings. You explain the situation, and he tells you, "Keep in mind that this company started out as an engineering firm, and it's still an engineering firm at heart. However, we've evolved here a bit. In the old dinosaur days, if you messed up, you were told about your failure in no uncertain terms. Today, we're a bit kinder and gentler. We'll still let you know when you mess up, but we try to be a little more sympathetic."

                            <br />
                            With Baskin's words in mind, you consider how to begin your message to the team leader. You believe you've got some options. Consider the opening approaches below and determine which would be the most appropriate way, given the situation and Baskin's advice.

                                An apology can make the delivery of your bad news more awkward and difficult, because apologies can be construed in many different ways. It may be an expression of sympathy that something negative has happened to the other person, or it might be taken as an admission of guilt.

                                A well-written buffer statement that shows appreciation for the team's efforts will help create a shared understanding of the situation and encourage a sense of trust as you deliver the negative message. However, be careful not to divert attention from the problem with insincere flattery or mislead the team into thinking your message actually contains good news.

                                    You will have delivered the news, but perhaps not in the most constructive way. First, you've ignored Baskin's advice to be "a bit kinder and gentler." Second, although this approach is candid, it might cause more problems than it solves if Kenisha tunes out as soon as she learns of the rejection.

                                First, the tone was too informal and overly friendly. When apologizing, you should adopt a friendly but somewhat formal tone. Second, you can express sympathy without asking for forgiveness. Why are you asking Kenisha for forgiveness? You're delivering a business decision.

                                    It is overly dramatic. Although you are trying to be sympathetic, Kenisha will likely see your effort as sappy and overly sentimental.

                                    On the plus side, you used a tone that is firm and slightly formal. However, you can express sympathy without accepting responsibility and/or guilt. Unless you were directly responsible for Radio-DRM's design flaws, assuming responsibility is inappropriate.

                            You're about to start drafting your message when Lloyd Baskin calls. "I forgot to tell you one other thing. Although it's important that you state the bad news clearly to Kenisha, I'm a little concerned that she'll take the news badly. You might try softening the impact of the bad news by using a passive voice instead of an active one. Sometimes using a passive voice seems less like an accusation. Just a suggestion!"

                            <br />
                            You remember from your college courses that, in an active voice, the subject performs the action of the verb. In a passive voice, the subject does not perform the action of the verb.

                            The first issue you chose to address with Kenisha is that production cost of the product appears to be too high versus the price customers would be willing to pay. The overwhelming sentiment of the focus groups conducted by the marketing department was that, although customers liked some of the advanced features of the Radio-DRM, they would not be willing to pay a higher price for these features. The result is that the profit margin for the Radio-DRM would be too low to justify going into production.

In short, the profit margin on the Radio-DRM is unacceptable as the product is currently configured. Your team needs to take aim at eliminating features that increase costs but add little value to the customer.

                                                ​We've got a problem with cost. You've put lots of bells and whistles in the Radio-DRM, and that drives up the cost, but customers in the focus groups don't want to have to pay for those bells and whistles. They see those features as "nice-to-haves" that maybe they'll use and maybe they won't, but they certainly don't want to pay extra for them. If we go into production with this prototype, the company will be lucky if they break even, much less make a profit. Back to the drawing board, Kenisha!

                                                ​First, let's talk about cost. To be blunt, you and your team need to be customer-focused, not technology-focused. Think about features our customers want, not just features that you want. You've put so many bells and whistles into the Radio-DRM that the production cost would be ridiculously high, and the focus groups show that customers don't want to pay extra for a lot of features they may or may not use. In short, we'd be lucky to break even on the Radio-DRM, much less make a profit. You and your team need to tweak the design so that you cut some of the unnecessary features and lower the cost.

You've made this product so fancy and added so many features that it's going to be horrifically expensive to produce, and our customers don't want to pay that much. That's what the focus groups have told us. Stop over-engineering the products and develop something that our customers want and that we can make a profit from.

Kenisha is likely to feel blamed rather than respected. On a positive note, however, you did suggest a strategy for remedying the issue with the prototype.

                            The first issue you chose to address with Kenisha is the size and styling of the prototype. One objection raised by the focus groups conducted by the marketing department is that the Radio-DRM is too big to fit into their entertainment centers and its bulk makes it equally unattractive if they wanted to place it on a bookshelf or tabletop.

Many consumers felt that the Radio-DRM was too large to fit into their entertainment centers. If they don't have an entertainment center, they want electronics that are sleek and look attractive on a bookshelf or tabletop, and they thought the Radio-DRM was too bulky and unattractive. I'd like to see the team try to streamline the design to make it more in line with customer expectations.

On the negative side, focus group customers don't want battleships in their entertainment centers, on their bookshelves, or on their tabletops. They want a product that is sleek and stylish and looks good. Start thinking like customers, not engineers, and make the design sexier.

Based on the data we received from our focus groups, the Radio-DRM is too big ​and bulky, and lacks the sleek sophistication that consumers want in their electronics. Perhaps this is because you've over-engineered the product and put in too many controls, knobs, and displays, but it's not going over well with potential consumers.

                            ​The second issue you chose to address with Kenisha is that production cost of the product appears to be too high versus the price customers would be willing to pay. The overwhelming sentiment of the focus groups conducted by the marketing department was that, although customers liked some of the advanced features of the Radio-DRM, they would not be willing to pay a higher price for these features. The result is that the profit margin for the Radio-DRM would be too low to justify going into production.

In short, the profit margin on the Radio-DRM is unacceptable as the product is currently configured. Your team needs to take aim at eliminating features that increase costs but add little value to the customer.

                                                ​We've also got a problem with cost. You've put lots of bells and whistles in the Radio-DRM, and that drives up the cost, but customers in the focus groups don't want to have to pay for those bells and whistles. They see those as "nice-to-haves" that maybe they'll use and maybe they won't, but they certainly don't want to pay extra for them. If we go into production with this prototype, the company will be lucky if they break even, much less make a profit. Back to the drawing board, Kenisha!

                                                Now let's talk about cost. To be blunt, you and your team need to be customer-focused, not technology-focused. Think about features our customers want, not just features that you want. You've put so many bells and whistles into the Radio-DRM that the production cost will be ridiculously high, and the focus groups show that customers don't want to pay extra for a lot of features they may or may not use. In short, we'd be lucky to break even on the Radio-DRM, much less make a profit. You and your team need to tweak the design so that you cut some of the unnecessary features and lower the cost.

You've made this product so fancy and added so many features that it's going to be horrifically expensive to produce, and our customers don't want to pay that much. That's what the focus groups have told us. Stop over-engineering the products and develop something that our customers want and that we can make a profit from.

Telling Kenisha ​that the team needs to be customer-focused rather than technology-focused is accusatory, and telling her that the team needs to think about features the customers want begs the question, "Were customer wants made clear to the team at the beginning?" Kenisha is likely to feel blamed rather than respected. On a positive note, however, you did suggest a strategy for remedying the issue with the prototype.

The marketing department conducted numerous focus groups to gauge their reaction to the prototype, and the feedback from these focus groups revealed that customers perceived the product to be too complicated and not sufficiently user-friendly.

The marketing department conducted numerous focus groups to gauge their reaction to the prototype, and the feedback from these focus groups revealed that customers perceived the product to be too complicated and not sufficiently user-friendly.

Another objection raised by the focus groups conducted by the marketing department is that the Radio-DRM is too big to fit into their entertainment centers, and its bulk makes it equally unattractive if they wanted to place it on a bookshelf or tabletop.

Customers want sleek designs, not something that looks like their grandfather's radio. They've said that the unit is too big to fit into an entertainment center and just too ugly to put on a bookshelf or tabletop.

Many consumers felt that the Radio-DRM was too large to fit into their entertainment centers. If they don't have an entertainment center, they want electronics that are sleek and look attractive on a bookshelf or tabletop, and they thought the Radio-DRM was too bulky and unattractive. I'd like to see the team try to streamline the design to make it more in line with customer expectations.

On the negative side, focus group customers don't want battleships in their entertainment centers, on their bookshelves, or on their tabletops. They want a product that is sleek and stylish and looks good. Start thinking like customers, not engineers, and make the design sexier.

                                                ​The good news, Kenisha, is that the last issue with respect to the Radio-DRM prototype is one that should be relatively easy for your team to solve: style. Based on the data we received from our focus groups, the Radio-DRM is too big, too bulky, and lacks the sleek sophistication that consumers want in their electronics. Perhaps this is because you've over-engineered the product and put in too many controls, knobs, and displays, but it's not going over well with potential consumers.

Another objection raised by the focus groups conducted by the marketing department is that the Radio-DRM is too big to fit into their entertainment centers, and its bulk makes it equally unattractive if they wanted to place it on a bookshelf or tabletop.

Many consumers felt that the Radio-DRM was too large to fit into their entertainment centers. If they don't have an entertainment center, they want electronics that are sleek and look attractive on a bookshelf or tabletop, and they thought the Radio-DRM was too bulky and unattractive. I'd like to see the team try to streamline the design to make it more in line with customer expectations.

                                                ​The good news, Kenisha, is that the last issue with respect to the Radio-DRM prototype is one that should be relatively easy for your team to solve: style. Based on the data we received from our focus groups, the Radio-DRM is too big, too bulky, and lacks the sleek sophistication that consumers want in their electronics. Perhaps this is because you've over-engineered the product and put in too many controls, knobs, and displays, but it's not going over well with potential consumers.

                            ​The last issue you chose to address with Kenisha is that production cost of the product appears to be too high versus the price customers would be willing to pay. The overwhelming sentiment of the focus groups conducted by the marketing department was that, while customers liked some of the advanced features of the Radio-DRM, they would not be willing to pay a higher price for these features. The result is that the profit margin for the Radio-DRM would be too low to justify going into production.

Although customers liked some of the Radio-DRM's advanced features, focus groups revealed that they wouldn't be willing to pay a higher price for those features. In short, the profit margin on the Radio-DRM is unacceptable as the product is currently configured. Your team needs to take aim at eliminating features that increase costs but add little value to the customer.

                                                ​​Finally, we've also got a problem with cost. You've put lots of bells and whistles in the Radio-DRM, and that drives up the cost, but customers in the focus groups don't want to have to pay for those bells and whistles. They see those as "nice-to-haves" that maybe they'll use and maybe they won't,  but they certainly don't want to pay extra for them. If we go into production with this prototype, the company will be lucky if they break even, much less make a profit. Back to the drawing board, Kenisha!

Think about features our customers want, not just features that you want.  You've put so many bells and whistles into the Radio-DRM that the production cost will be ridiculously high, and the focus groups show that customers don't want to pay extra for a lot of features they may or may not use. In short, we'd be lucky to break even on the Radio-DRM, much less make a profit. ​You and your team need to tweak the design so that you cut some of the unnecessary features and lower the cost.

                                                ​​The final reason we're rejecting the prototype is the cost. You've made this product so fancy and added so many features that it's going to be horrifically expensive to produce, and our customers don't want to pay that much. That's what the focus groups have told us. Stop over-engineering the products and develop something that our customers want and that we can make a profit from.

Telling Kenisha ​that the team needs to be customer-focused rather than technology-focused is accusatory, and telling her that the team needs to think about features the customers want begs the question, "Were customer wants made clear to the team at the beginning?" ​Kenisha is likely to feel blamed rather than respected. On a positive note, however, you did suggest a strategy for remedying the issue with the prototype.

                                You've done a good job of closing on a positive note by commending Kenisha and her team, but it would have been better to steer clear of the cliché that she should let you know if you can be of help.

                                    Remember that the close is the last thing Kenisha will have to remember from your message, and telling her that she and her team have let you down does not treat her with respect. Another option would have been a better choice.
